# Weather and Air Traffic Analysis

This repository contains scripts for collecting and analyzing aviation weather and air traffic data.

These scripts were created for a NASA-funded project to study the use of air traffic flow management initiatives.  Obviously, feel free to use them for whatever purpose you like. The project focused on the years 2010 to 2014, and so the scripts refer to data covering this time period.

## Data collection

Many of the scripts in this repository are for downloading various formats of weather data.

[METAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR) data describe observed weather at airports.

**North American Regional Reanalysis** or [NARR](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/north-american-regional-reanalysis-narr) data describe observed weather across North America.

**Rapid Update Cycle** or [RUC](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/rapid-update-cycle-ruc) and its replacement **Rapid Refresh** or [RAP](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/rapid-refresh-rap) data describe forecast weather across North America.

All of the following are available to the general public online.
